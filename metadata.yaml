# List of Citations this dataset is derived from.
# We use CSL-JSON fields to represent a structured citation, see below for the main fields used for bibliographies.
#
# NAME fields:
# are lists of people represented either by a simple string or objects with family & given fields.
# In case no parsed name can be provided, simple strings will be parsed.
# For the parsing to given and family name to correctly work it is highly recommended to use one of the following formats:
#   1) GivenName FamilyName: Only use this in case the last name is a single token. There can be many first names e.g. John Paul Sartre
#   2) FamilyName, GivenName: Supports any conmplex last name. E.g. Brinch Hansen, Per
#
# DATE fields:
# are ISO dates that can be truncated to represent a year, year & month or exact date: 1998, 1998-05 or 1998-05-21
